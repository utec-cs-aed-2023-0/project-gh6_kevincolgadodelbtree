# Blockchain - Project

Implementation done in C++ as our final project for: Algorithms and Data Structures course.  

![Blockchain](https://cryptoconexion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blockchainseguro-1024x607.jpg)

We used some Bitcoin design principles including SHA256 to hash block information and headers, and mining.

**Requirements**
- Uses C++(idk what version)
- Hash++ library
- JSON from nlohmann library
 
And unfortunately, everything is stored in memory and is deleted when program quits. We are not using dynamic allocation.

## BlockChain Object
Genesis block is created during initialization.  
The blockchain variables are:
```cpp
int difficulty; // Amount of 0's for the proof-of-work.
int nregs; // Block's ID.
uuid_64 lastblock; // Last Block ID.
Block UncommitedBlock; // Current in-develop Block.
int transactNo; // Amount of transactions on the current Block.
```

### Block Object
```cpp
uuid_64 id; // Self-explantory
int salt = 0; // Nonce
uint512_t prev; // Previous block ID
Transaction transactions[BLOCK_SIZE]; // Array with transactions.
```

#### Transaction Object
```cpp
uuid_64 recipient; // Self-explantory
uuid_64 sender; // Self-explantory
int64_t momentoftransact; // Unix-Epoch of transaction.
int64_t qty; // Money sent (Cents, Dolars, Crypto-Coins, etc).
```

Everytime a block is added to the blockchain it will check that the given hash is valid (With a difficulty of 5, the hash must start with 0x00000...).

#### This repository uses hashing functions from https://github.com/D7EAD/HashPlusPlus.

#### JSON Library from nlohmann (JSON for Modern C++)
In our Project we use a modern json library that helps us to write, read, merge, convert and a lot of other functions.
